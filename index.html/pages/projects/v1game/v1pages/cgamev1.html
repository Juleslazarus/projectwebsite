      <p class="text"> The rules are simmple. you get hit with a situation,
      you make a choie, and then you move on. You will be given between 1
      and 3 choices to pick from. There are no right choises; however you
      will notice certain choices are colored differently like so:</p>
      <img > <!-- image will go here to showcase what the choises look like -->
      <p class="text"> Stick to the following and you'll be fine!</p>
      <p1 class="text"> the</p1> <p1 class="gc"> first </p1> <p1> choice is green.
      this means that this response is the least aggressive or
       assertive choice. This will lead you to different outcomes
       as the other one or two choices.
     </p1>

     <p1 class="text"> the</p1><p1 class="yc"> second </p1> <p1> choice is orange.
      This means that this response is the middle ground. Both assertive/
      aggressive but not overdoing it! This will also lead to a different outcome!
      </p1>

      <p1 class="text"> the</p1><p1 class="rc"> third </p1><p1> choice is RED.
        This means that this response is the most aggressive and or assertive, really
      the far end of the other spectrum, choice that you can make!. Again this choice
      will likely lead you to an entirely different outcome than following the green
      choices the entire way!</p1>

        <p> Okay so confession time! Sometimes two choices can lead you to the same
        outcome, but oh well what can you do about it.</p>

          orange or red responses and the number is the corresponding door or question that opens up after beginning the game for said response. later this will get more advanced as
          the game progresses forms a branch like system-->
